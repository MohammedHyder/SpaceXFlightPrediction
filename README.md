# SpaceXFlightPrediction

The purpose of this project was to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, given a number of important criteria. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course. 

The project has the following four components:
- EDA with pandas and SQL data selection
- Matplotlib, Folium, and Plotly Dash python interactive visualization and dashboard analytics
- Logistic regression, decision tree, svm, and knn classification and predictive analytics
- Executive summary and data report
